=== The Rails Guessing Game ===
This is a simple Rails version of the guessing
game in Ruby found at
https://github.com/scharlau/RubyPractice/tree/master/02/guess. We now want to
use this to develop a Rails version for use online.

As before, this is to be used as a 'Deliberate Practice' session. So there is no
one 'correct' solution. The goal of the session is to take the time to work with
someone else if possible, or on your own, to explore how you might make the code
better than it is. This is a prototype, a learning tool, so has some parts which
should be improved upon both in the way logic is handled, and in the design of
the pages.

For this game we still have the game.rb model as before, and some of the game
logic has moved to the games_controller.rb file. The views have been modified a
little to show more of what's happening in the database, but have otherwise are
what is provided by Rails scaffolding.

== Running the Game ===
When you create a new 'game' you create a new row in the
database and need to enter your 'guess'. When you click 'create game' your guess
is compared to the random number and the result shown. If you want to 'guess'
again, then use the 'edit' link to do so and when you update the form.

Start fixing things that you notice could be done better. As you go along with
your work, decide whether this is something that is best done in a new branch of
git, so that you can then merge it back to the main branch when done, or give
you the option of deleting the branch if it doesn't go smoothly.

==What to do next ==
First round, fix the game so that it correctly tells you if
you won. Second round, make the forms only show, and allow to edit, only what
they need to play the game. Third round, fix anything else, which you think
could be done better.
